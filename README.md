## ðŸ§½ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Excel + Power Query)

The original Superstore dataset contained inconsistencies and required shaping before analysis. Here's how the preprocessing was done:

### âœ… Steps Performed in Power Query Editor:

1. **Removed Unnecessary Columns:**
   - Dropped fields like Postal Code and Country which had no variance.

2. **Handled Missing Values:**
   - Filtered out rows with missing `Order Date`, `Sales`, or `Category`.

3. **Changed Data Types:**
   - Converted `Order Date` and `Ship Date` to proper Date format.
   - Changed `Quantity` and `Profit` to numeric types.

4. **Created New Columns:**
   - Extracted **Year** and **Month** from `Order Date` for trend analysis.
   - Added `Profit Margin` column using:  
     `Profit Margin = (Profit / Sales) * 100`

5. **Normalized Categories:**
   - Corrected inconsistencies in `Segment` and `Category` naming.
   - Ensured all textual columns were trimmed and properly cased.

6. **Loaded Clean Data into Power BI:**
   - Final preprocessed table was loaded directly into Power BI for visualization.
